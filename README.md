# EulerLagrangePendulum
In this Python notebook, through numerical solutions of Euler-Lagrange equations with arbitrary parameters, we analyze how mathematical pendulum behaves under certain conditions.
First, we analyze regular; external force-free, mathematical pendulum, allowing any starting angle, as well as starting length (through process, this length extends to 
real length of pendulum) - we sketch the graphs of trajectory, graphs of vertical angle, as well as angular velocity of the pendulum, etc.
Then, we allow for an external force, whose moment is given first as a sinusoidal function of time and then as a square-wave function. We sketch the same graphs as in 
aforementioned case. 
Finally, for second case, we analyze amplitude characteristics of pendulum trajectory and notice expected effects (such as resonance, for example).
